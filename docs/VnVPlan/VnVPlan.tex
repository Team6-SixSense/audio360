\section{Introduction}

This document outlines the comprehensive verification and validation plan for
\progname{}, an assistive device designed to aid individuals who are deaf or
hard of hearing by providing real-time visual indications of sound source
locations and classifications through smart glasses. The plan ensures that the
system meets all specified requirements and delivers reliable, safe
functionality for its intended users.

The verification and validation process is structured around three main phases:
verification of the Software Requirements Specification (SRS), design
verification, and implementation verification. This plan addresses both
functional and non-functional requirements through systematic testing
approaches, including unit testing, integration testing, and user validation
sessions. The roadmap prioritizes safety-critical features first, ensuring that
the most important functionality is thoroughly validated before moving to
enhanced features.

\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}

\progname{} is an embedded assistive device that processes real-time audio
signals from a microphone array mounted on smart glasses to provide visual
feedback about sound source locations and classifications. The system consists
of several key components: embedded firmware for real-time audio processing,
audio filtering for frequency domain conversion, direction of arrival (DoA)
analysis for spatial awareness, sound classification for identifying audio
sources, and a visualization controller for displaying information to users.

The software being tested includes the complete embedded system running on a
microcontroller, with components for audio capture, signal processing,
classification, directional analysis algorithms, and visual output generation.
The system operates as a closed embedded environment with no external
connectivity, ensuring reliability and security for its safety-critical
application domain.

\subsection{Objectives}

The primary objectives of this verification and validation plan are:

\textbf{Primary Objectives:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Software Correctness:} Build confidence that the system
    correctly implements all functional requirements, particularly
    safety-critical features such as direction of arrival estimation and sound
    classification with 90\% accuracy.
    
    \item \textbf{Real-time Performance:} Demonstrate that the system meets all
    timing constraints, including processing audio at 16 kHz sampling rate
    (\hyperref[SRS-NFR1_2]{NF1.2}) and providing visual feedback within 1 second
    latency (\hyperref[SRS-sec:VC-4.1]{VC-4.1}).
    
    \item \textbf{User Safety and Usability:} Validate that the system
    effectively addresses the needs of individuals who are deaf or hard of
    hearing through structured user testing sessions with the McMaster Sign
    Language Club.
    
    \item \textbf{System Reliability:} Ensure robust error handling and fault
    tolerance, particularly for memory management and hardware component
    failures.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Objectives Out of Scope:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{External Library Verification:} Third-party libraries (such as
    FFT implementations and machine learning frameworks) are assumed to be
    verified by their respective development teams. We will focus on testing our
    integration and usage of these libraries.
    
    \item \textbf{Long-term Durability Testing:} Extended wear testing and
    long-term hardware reliability assessment are beyond the scope of this
    academic project due to time constraints.
        
    \item \textbf{3D Spatial Localization:} Testing of elevation angle
    determination is out of scope as the system is designed for 2D horizontal
    plane analysis only.
\end{itemize}

This prioritization ensures that critical safety and functionality requirements
are thoroughly validated while acknowledging resource limitations and project
scope constraints.

\subsection{Challenge Level and Extras}

\textbf{Challenge Level:} Advanced

This project operates at an advanced challenge level due to the complex
integration of real-time signal processing, embedded systems development, and
safety-critical applications. The system requires sophisticated audio processing
techniques including FFT analysis, direction of arrival estimation, and
real-time classification algorithms running on resource-constrained hardware. A
particularly challenging aspect is achieving precise microphone synchronization,
as any timing discrepancies between microphones will render direction of arrival
estimation impossible, effectively making the system's primary feature
unachievable.

\textbf{Extras:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Usability Testing:} Comprehensive user validation sessions
    with members of the McMaster Sign Language Club to ensure the system
    effectively addresses the needs of individuals who are deaf or hard of
    hearing. This includes structured interviews and observation sessions to
    validate both functionality and user experience.
    
    \item \textbf{Code Walkthroughs:} Systematic peer review processes for
    critical system components, particularly audio processing algorithms and
    safety-critical code paths. This ensures code quality and helps identify
    potential issues early in the development process.
    
    \item \textbf{User Documentation:} Development of comprehensive user guides
    and instructional materials to help end-users effectively utilize the
    system. This includes setup instructions, usage scenarios, and
    troubleshooting guides.
\end{itemize}

These extras enhance the project's value by ensuring both technical excellence
and practical usability for the target user community.

verification and validation, from high-level requirements through detailed
implementation specifications to user-focused validation criteria.

\section{Plan}

This section will go over the \hyperref[sec:vnv_team]{verification and
validation team}. It will then be followed by the plan to verify the
\hyperref[sec:srs_verification]{SRS},
\hyperref[sec:design_verification]{design},
\hyperref[sec:vnv_plan_verification]{verification and validation plan}, and
\hyperref[sec:implementation_verification]{implementation}. Finally the section
will end off with \hyperref[sec:testing_tools]{automated testing and
verification tools} and \hyperref[sec:software_validation]{software validation}.

\subsection{Verification and Validation Team}\label{sec:vnv_team}

The table below outlines the roles and responsibilities of each team member
involved in the verification and validation process. Roles were intentionally
assigned to individuals not directly responsible for the corresponding
implementation components, ensuring an unbiased evaluation of system
functionality. The supervisor also contributes by providing technical oversight
and expert validation for signal processing.

\noindent
\textbf{Table: Verification and validation team breakdown}
\label{table:vnv_team}

\hline
\end{tabularx}

\subsection{SRS Verification}\label{sec:srs_verification}

The verification of the SRS will follow a structured and systematic process.
Each software requirement will be associated with at least one corresponding
test case, which will verify whether the implementation satisfies the intended
specification. Both unit and integration testing will be conducted to confirm
functionality at the component and system levels. To avoid bias, test cases will
be developed and executed by a team member who was not directly involved in the
implementation of the component. These fall under the
\hyperref[role:firmware_verfication]{firmware verification},
\hyperref[role:visual_vnv]{visual verification},
\hyperref[role:classification_verfication]{audio classification verification},
\hyperref[role:directional_verfication]{directional analysis verification}
roles. \newline

The team will adopt a new GitHub peer review process to SRS verification. A
comment will be added by bot to the PR. The comment will contain a list of
reminders for the reviewers to confirm that the software implementation and/or
written test cases comply with the requirements defined in the SRS. If a
requirement cannot be met, the reviewer will be instructed to request an update
in a separate PR linked with a rationale for the change. Below is the text that
is included in the bot's comment addressing this topic. \newline

\begin{shadedquotation}
Reviewer's Note

- Ensure that all implemented features and/or test cases comply with the SRS. If
any requirement cannot be met, link a separate PR updating the SRS and
explaining the rationale for the change.
\end{shadedquotation}

The 
\hyperref[role:audio_processing_verification]{supervisor verification process}
will follow a formal meeting based review approach. During these meetings, the
team will present core system elements, mainly audio processing methodologies,
using mathematical descriptions, prototype demonstrations, and graphed data. The
supervisor will be provided with targeted review questions and asked to identify
potential weaknesses or missing test cases. Feedback will be documented, and
resulting action items will be tracked and resolved through the project's issue
tracker. \newline


For validation, the team will engage users who are hard of hearing in structured
sessions. These sessions will include observation of product use and
semi-structured interviews. The observation aspect aims to allow the team
understand the usability of the product while the interview serves as a method
to identify validation issues in addressing user's needs related to situational
awareness. This will fall under the \hyperref[role:visual_vnv]{visual
validation} and \hyperref[role:product_validation]{product validation} roles.

\subsection{Design Verification}\label{sec:design_verification}

The design verification process will include structured peer reviews conducted
by the team. Below is the checklist to verify the design.\\
\newline
\textbf{Software Core Architecture} \\
$\square$ Does the selected software architecture appropriately support the all
system's requirements and intended functionality? \\
$\square$ Is the software design portable, allowing the software to be easily
integrated with different hardware or simulation layer. That is minimal changes
are required to migrate software to a new hardware. \\
\newline
\newline
\textbf{Software Design} \\
$\square$ Is the system decomposed into small, modular components that can be
individually tested? Tests should be able to verify single functionality. \\
$\square$ Are encapsulation principles followed, ensuring that data and
functions that should be private are private? \\
$\square$ Are design assumptions, dependencies, and interfaces clearly defined
and documented? Check in MIS documentation \cite{MIS} for this. \\
$\square$ Are software design principles being followed? Check box should fail
if there is an another design principle that will be better fitted.
\newline
\newline
\textbf{General} \\
$\square$ Is there atleast one corresponding UML diagram of the design being
tracked on git. \\

Reviewers will document feedback on any checklist criteria that are not
satisfied and provide recommendations for improvement. The team will track all
feedback using the project's issue tracker.

\subsection{Verification and Validation Plan Verification}
\label{sec:vnv_plan_verification}

The verification and validation plan verification process will include
structured peer reviews conducted by the Teaching Assistant and Team 13. They
will use the checklist from \texttt{Checklists/VnV-Checklist.pdf}.

\subsection{Implementation Verification}\label{sec:implementation_verification}

As outlined in the development plan, the primary source code implementation will
be developed in C/C++. The compiler used to build the source code will provide
warnings of potential bugs. The team will resolve all warnings that is under the
team's control, this excludes warnings from imported libraries. \newline

The team will also employ Clang Static Analyzer \cite{clangStaticAnalyzer} as a
static analyzer tool. The static analyzer will be employed to detect bugs
without running the source code on the hardware, and will be ran prior to
merging PRs. It will block the PR from merging until all issues identified by
the static analyzer has been resolved.

The team will also develop test that verify requirements. These tests are
outline in the \hyperref[sec:system_tests]{System Tests section}. Other
non-dynamic tests, such as review cadence and code inspections, will not be
performed as these activities take a lot of time and effort. Due to limited
bandwidth of the team, automated non-dynamic tests will be prioritized. 

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}
\label{sec:testing_tools}

Automated testing and verification tools are defined in the following sections
from the Development Plan document.

\begin{itemize}
  \item 10.3: Linter, Static Analyzer and Formatting Tools
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Clangformat \cite{ClangFormat}
    \item Clang Static Analyzer \cite{clangStaticAnalyzer}
  \end{itemize}
  \item 10.4: Testing Frameworks (section also includes code coverage)
  \begin{itemize}
    \item GoogleTest \cite{GoogleTest}
    \item pytest \cite{pytest}
    \item gcov \cite{gcov} / lcov \cite{lcov}
  \end{itemize}
  \item 10.5: CI/CD (contains automated testing plan in CI)
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Run all unit tests (PR blocking)
    \item Build source code using compiler (PR blocking)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

As the software will be deployed on an embedded device, running unit tests on
hardware is infeasible. As a result, all unit tests will be done on developer's
local machine without any hardware in loop.

\subsection{Software Validation}\label{sec:software_validation}

The \hyperref[role:product_validation]{Product Validation} role, defined in
section \hyperref[sec:vnv_team]{3.1: Verification and Validation Team}, is
responsible for validating the product with the primary stakeholder. The product
is composed of both software and hardware with more focus on the software. The
validation will be conducted primarily with members of the McMaster Sign
Language Club, who may not have the technical expertise to evaluate the
requirements from the SRS. To address this, the Product Validation team member
will conduct semi-structured interviews as described in section
\hyperref[sec:srs_verification]{3.2: SRS Verification}. Rev 0 demo will include
the results of the user validation, providing an opportunity to gather feedback
and improve the software.
\newline
\newline
The criteria for success for validation with the primary stakeholder is as
follows:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Users are more situationally aware of their environments compared to
  without the technology in some enviroments. This directly addresses the
  stakeholder's main pain point.
  \item The provided sound classification and directional indicators helps the
  users take appropriate actions at the moment. This directly related to
  \hyperref[SRS-goal:visual_display]{Goal G.4} (non-obstructive display)
  \item The user can use the product for an extended period of time without
  discomfort. This directly relates to
  \hyperref[SRS-goal:user_comfort]{Goal G.1.6} (user comfort).
\end{itemize}


This information will be derived by analyzing the data from the 
\hyperref[sec:usability_survery_questions]{Usability Survey Questions} set.


\section{System Tests} \label{sec:system_tests}

This section outlines the tests for verifying and validating the functional and
nonfunctional requirements outlined in the SRS \cite{SRS}. When done correctly
this ensures the system meets the user expectations and performs reliably. 

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

The sections below outline the tests that will be used to verify the functional
requirements in section \hyperref[SRS-sec:S.2]{S.2} of the SRS. Each subsection
will focus on how the functional requirements for a specific component will be
verified through testing. These components include the Embedded Firmware, Driver
Layer, Audio Filtering, Audio360 Engine, Frequency Analysis, Visualization
Controller, Microphone, Output Display and Microcontroller. 

\subsubsection{Embedded Firmware Tests}

This section covers the tests for ensuring the embedded firmware correctly
manages system tasks, audio synchronization, error handling, and hardware
diagnostics. Each test is associated with a functional requirement defined under
section \hyperref[SRS-sec:FR1]{3.2.1} of the SRS. As such, each test will verify
whether the system meets the associated functional requirement.

\begin{enumerate}

\item{\textbf{Test-FR-1.1} Priority-based task scheduling \\}

\textbf{Control:} Automatic
					
\textbf{Initial State:} 
The firmware is deployed on the microcontroller with a task scheduler
initialized. Multiple tasks with different priority levels are registered in the
system.
					
\textbf{Input:}
Three concurrent tasks submitted to the firmware scheduler: Task A with high
priority (priority level 1), Task B with medium priority (priority level 5), and
Task C with low priority (priority level 10). Each task logs its execution start
time with microsecond precision when it begins execution.
					
\textbf{Output:}
Execution logs show that tasks execute in priority order: Task A starts first,
followed by Task B, then Task C. The logged timestamps confirm this execution
sequence regardless of submission order.

\textbf{Test Case Derivation:} 
Priority-based scheduling ensures that critical tasks (audio processing, safety
diagnostics) execute before less critical tasks. The scheduler must respect
priority assignments to meet real-time constraints. Higher priority tasks (lower
numerical values) must preempt or execute before lower priority tasks.
					
\textbf{How test will be performed:}
Deploy test firmware with three mock tasks to the microcontroller. Submit all
three tasks simultaneously. Collect execution logs from the microcontroller.
Analyze timestamps to verify execution order matches priority order. The test
passes if Task A executes before Task B, and Task B executes before Task C in
all test runs.

\item{\textbf{Test-FR-1.2} Audio signal synchronization\\}

\textbf{Control:} Manual
					
\textbf{Initial State:} 
The firmware is deployed on the microcontroller with all four microphones
connected and initialized. Audio capture subsystem is ready to receive data.
					
\textbf{Input:}
An impulse sound (hand clap or tone burst) played in the environment, captured
simultaneously by all four microphones. The same acoustic event should be
detected by all microphones with known time delays based on geometry.
					
\textbf{Output:}
Four synchronized audio buffers, each containing the impulse signal.
Cross-correlation analysis between channels shows time alignment within margins
of 10 microseconds, accounting for physical microphone spacing. All channels
have matching sample rates and frame timestamps.

\textbf{Test Case Derivation:} 
Accurate direction of arrival estimation requires precise temporal alignment
across microphone channels. Misalignment exceeding 10 microseconds will degrade
localization accuracy per the system's spatial resolution requirements.
					
\textbf{How test will be performed:}
Generate acoustic impulse at known location. Capture audio on all four channels
for 1 second. Export captured buffers to analysis software. Compute
cross-correlation between all channel pairs. Calculate maximum time delay
between channels. The test passes if all channel pairs show time alignment
within 10 microseconds after compensating for physical propagation delays.

\item{\textbf{Test-FR-1.3} Memory error handling\\}

\textbf{Control:} Automatic
					
\textbf{Initial State:} 
The firmware is running on the microcontroller with memory monitoring enabled.
Available heap and stack memory are known and logged.
					
\textbf{Input:}
A test sequence that attempts to allocate memory buffers of increasing size
until allocation would exceed available heap memory. The sequence includes: (1)
valid allocation within limits, (2) allocation at memory limit, (3) allocation
exceeding memory limit.
					
\textbf{Output:}
For valid allocations, memory is allocated successfully and functions return
success codes. For allocation exceeding limits, the firmware detects the
condition, denies the allocation, returns an appropriate error code, and
continues operation without crashing. System remains stable and responsive after
handling the error.

\textbf{Test Case Derivation:} 
Memory exhaustion on embedded systems causes system crashes if not handled
properly. The firmware must detect out-of-memory conditions before they cause
undefined behavior. Graceful error handling prevents system failures that would
leave users without situational awareness.
					
\textbf{How test will be performed:}
Execute automated test suite that progressively allocates memory buffers.
Monitor system logs for allocation attempts and results. Verify that memory
allocations within limits succeed. Verify that allocations exceeding limits
return error codes without system crash. Confirm system continues responding to
commands after error conditions. The test passes if all error conditions are
caught and the system remains operational.

\item{\textbf{Test-FR-1.4} Hardware diagnostics\\}

\textbf{Control:} Manual
					
\textbf{Initial State:} 
The firmware is deployed with all hardware components (microphones, display,
etc.) connected and operational. Diagnostic subsystem is initialized and logging
is enabled.
					
\textbf{Input:}
A sequence of hardware fault conditions introduced systematically: (1)
disconnect one microphone, (2) disconnect display interface, (3) restore all
connections. Normal operation continues between fault injections.
					
\textbf{Output:}
For each fault condition, the diagnostic system detects the hardware error
within 1 second and logs appropriate error codes identifying the failed
component. When connections are restored, the diagnostic system detects recovery
and clears error flags. All detections and recoveries are timestamped in logs.

\textbf{Test Case Derivation:} 
Continuous hardware monitoring enables the system to detect failures in
real-time and inform users about degraded functionality. Quick detection (within
1 second) ensures users are aware of system limitations. Component
identification in error logs aids in troubleshooting and repair.
					
\textbf{How test will be performed:}
Deploy firmware to microcontroller with all peripherals connected. Start
diagnostic logging. Systematically introduce each fault condition while
monitoring logs. Verify each fault is detected within 1 second by examining log
timestamps. Verify correct error codes are generated for each fault type.
Restore connections and verify recovery detection. The test passes if all faults
are detected within timing constraints with correct error identification.

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Driver Layer Tests}

This section covers the tests for ensuring the driver layer provides correct
hardware abstraction, permission handling, error propagation, and data
integrity. Each test is associated with a functional requirement defined under
section \hyperref[SRS-sec:FR2]{3.2.2} of the SRS. As such, each test will verify
whether the system meets the associated functional requirement.

\begin{enumerate}

\item{\textbf{Test-FR-2.1} Hardware interface abstraction \\}

\textbf{Control:} Automatic
					
\textbf{Initial State:} 
The driver layer is compiled and running on the microcontroller. Hardware
peripherals (GPIO for display, timers, etc.) are connected and initialized. Test
application with driver API access is ready to execute.
					
\textbf{Input:}
A test sequence that invokes driver API functions for different hardware
operations: (1) read from ADC channel, (2) write to GPIO pin, (3) configure
timer, (4) read system clock. Each operation uses the driver's abstracted
interface rather than direct hardware register access.
					
\textbf{Output:}
All driver API calls complete successfully and return expected data. ADC reads
return valid voltage samples. GPIO writes toggle pin states visible on
oscilloscope. Timer configuration produces expected timing behavior. System
clock reads return monotonically increasing timestamps. No direct hardware
register access is required by the test application.

\textbf{Test Case Derivation:} 
Hardware abstraction through the driver layer enables higher-level software to
interact with peripherals without hardware-specific knowledge. This abstraction
makes the software portable and maintainable. The driver must provide complete
functionality for all hardware operations required by application components.
					
\textbf{How test will be performed:}
Compile test application that uses only driver API calls (no direct register
access). Deploy to microcontroller. Execute test sequence exercising each driver
function. Verify all operations complete successfully through return codes. Use
oscilloscope to verify GPIO toggles. Use serial logging to verify ADC readings
are within expected ranges. The test passes if all driver operations execute
correctly and provide expected functionality.

\item{\textbf{Test-FR-2.2} Permission-based hardware access\\}

\textbf{Control:} Automatic
					
\textbf{Initial State:} 
The driver layer is running with a permission system configured. Two software
modules are registered: Module A with high privilege (full hardware access),
Module B with restricted privilege (limited hardware access).
					
\textbf{Input:}
Test requests from both modules attempting to access hardware resources: (1)
Module A requests ADC access (allowed by permissions), (2) Module B requests ADC
access (denied by permissions), (3) Module A requests GPIO write (allowed), (4)
Module B requests GPIO write (denied).
					
\textbf{Output:}
Module A's requests complete successfully with hardware operations executed.
Module B's requests are rejected by the driver layer, returning permission
denied error codes without executing hardware operations. System logs show
permission checks for all requests.

\textbf{Test Case Derivation:} 
Permission-based access control prevents unauthorized or unintended hardware
operations that could compromise system safety or stability. The driver must
enforce access policies to maintain system integrity. Only authorized components
should control critical hardware like ADCs and display interfaces.
					
\textbf{How test will be performed:}
Configure driver with permission rules for test modules. Execute test requests
from both modules in sequence. Verify Module A's requests succeed by checking
return codes. Verify Module B's requests are denied by checking for error codes.
Examine system logs to confirm permission checks occurred. The test passes if
all access decisions match configured permissions.

\item{\textbf{Test-FR-2.3} Error code propagation\\}

\textbf{Control:} Automatic
					
\textbf{Initial State:} 
The driver layer is running on the microcontroller. Hardware is in a state where
specific error conditions can be triggered (e.g., ADC not initialized, invalid
GPIO pin specified).
					
\textbf{Input:}
A sequence of driver API calls designed to trigger various error conditions: (1)
read from uninitialized ADC channel, (2) write to invalid GPIO pin number, (3)
configure timer with out-of-range parameters, (4) read from disconnected
peripheral.
					
\textbf{Output:}
For each error condition, the driver returns a specific error code identifying
the failure type (e.g., ERROR\_NOT\_INITIALIZED, ERROR\_INVALID\_PIN,
ERROR\_INVALID\_PARAMETER, \\ ERROR\_HARDWARE\_DISCONNECTED). Error codes are
returned immediately without hanging or crashing. Higher-level software receives
these codes and can take appropriate action.

\textbf{Test Case Derivation:} 
Proper error reporting enables higher-level software to detect and handle
hardware failures gracefully. Error codes must be specific enough to identify
the failure cause. Immediate return of error codes (without blocking) maintains
real-time system responsiveness.
					
\textbf{How test will be performed:}
Execute test sequence that triggers each error condition. Capture return codes
from driver API calls. Verify each return code matches the expected error type.
Measure time from API call to return to confirm immediate propagation (less than
10 milliseconds). The test passes if all error conditions return correct,
specific error codes within timing constraints.

\item{\textbf{Test-FR-2.4} Data integrity maintenance\\}

\textbf{Control:} Automatic
					
\textbf{Initial State:} 
The driver layer is managing multiple memory regions for audio buffers, each
actively being written by ADC DMA (Direct Memory Access) and read by audio
processing software. System is configured for continuous audio capture.
					
\textbf{Input:}
Continuous audio input for 30 seconds, captured into circular buffers managed by
the driver layer. Test includes concurrent read and write operations to simulate
real-time processing conditions.
					
\textbf{Output:}
Audio data in buffers maintains integrity throughout the test period. No buffer
corruption occurs (verified by checksum or known test pattern). No data races
between writers (DMA) and readers (audio processing) cause invalid data. Buffer
state transitions are atomic and consistent.

\textbf{Test Case Derivation:} 
Data integrity is critical in audio processing systems where corrupted samples
lead to incorrect analysis results. The driver must protect shared memory
regions from concurrent access issues. Proper buffer management prevents
overruns and data races that would degrade system reliability.
					
\textbf{How test will be performed:}
Configure driver to manage audio buffers with continuous DMA writes. Start audio
capture with simultaneous reading by test application. Inject known test
patterns into audio stream at marked intervals. Verify test patterns are
correctly received without corruption. Monitor for buffer overflow or underflow
conditions. The test passes if all test patterns are received intact and no
memory corruption is detected over the 30-second duration.

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Audio Filtering Tests}

This section covers the tests for ensuring the system processes audio into a
form that can be analyzed by internal components of the system. Each test is
associated with a functional requirement defined under section
\hyperref[SRS-sec:FR3]{3.2.3} of the SRS. As such, each test will verify whether
the system meets the associated functional requirement. 

\begin{enumerate}

\item{\textbf{Test-FR-3.1} Converting time-domain audio signals to
frequency-domain \\}

\textbf{Control:} Automatic
					
\textbf{Initial State:} 
The audio filtering module is initialized and ready to process audio input
retrieved from an audio file. 
					
\textbf{Input:}
A 3 second audio clip represented in an audio file containing pre-recorded audio
data in the time domain sampled at 16 kHz. The audio clip contains 3 sine waves
at low (100 Hz), mid (1 kHz), and high (8 kHz) frequency ranges. No filtering or
frequency transformation have been applied to the audio data initially.
					
\textbf{Output:}
The audio filtering module accepts the file with no errors. The resulting
frequency domain representation should display 3 spectral peaks at approximately
100 Hz, 1 kHz, and 8 kHz, corresponding to the sine waves.

\textbf{Test Case Derivation:} 
The Fourier Transform converts time-domain signals into frequency domain by
independently extracting the frequency of various waves in the signals and
plotting the peaks at those frequencies after the transformation. In the
original audio clip, there are 3 sine waves at 100 Hz, 1 kHz, and 8 kHz. After
applying the Fourier Transform, the resulting frequency domain representation
should display peaks at those frequencies.
					
\textbf{How test will be performed:}
The test file will be uploaded as an artifact in the automated testing
framework. This test will trigger when a commit is made to any branch in the
repository. The audio filtering module will return the frequency domain
representation automatically on the input of the audio file. The
frequency-domain output will be inspected to verify the presence of peaks at 100
Hz, 1 kHz and 8 kHz. The test passes if all 3 peaks are present with no
unexpected frequencies showing up.  
					
\item{\textbf{Test-FR-3.2} Normalize amplitude of signals\\}

\textbf{Control:} Automatic
					
\textbf{Initial State:} 
The audio filtering module is initialized and ready to process audio input
retrieved from a audio file. 
					
\textbf{Input:}
A 2 second digital audio signal sampled at 16 kHz that alternates between a
low-amplitude sine wave and a high-amplitude sine wave with the same frequency.
These sine waves will be decimal multiples of a defined max amplitude value.
Where the low-sine wave will be 0.2 * max amplitude, and the high sine wave will
be 0.8 * max amplitude. 
					
\textbf{Output:}
A normalized output signal that still has both the low amplitude and high
amplitude sine waves, but both waves have been scaled to a consistent target
amplitude, having a maximum absolute value of 1.0. Note, the frequency of the
sine wave should remain unchanged. 

\textbf{Test Case Derivation:} 
Amplitude normalization scales the amplitude of a signal so its maximum
amplitude is between 0 and 1. If one section is quiet (0.2 * max), and another
section is louder (0.8 * max), normalization should scale both sections so their
peak amplitudes are between the range 0 and 1. 
					
\textbf{How test will be performed:}

The test file will be uploaded as an artifact in the automated testing
framework. This test will trigger when a commit is made to any branch in the
repository. The audio filtering module will return normalized time-domain signal
automatically on the input of the audio file. The normalized time domain output
will be inspected to verify the amplitude across both sections of the file are
the same now.

\item{\textbf{Test-FR-3.3} Reduced spectral leakage\\}

\textbf{Control:} Automatic
					
\textbf{Initial State:} 
The audio filtering module is initialized and ready to process audio input
retrieved from an audio file. 
					
\textbf{Input:}
A 1 second sine wave at an arbitrary frequency sampled at 16 kHz, whose duration
does not contain an integer number of cycle (the cycle is cut off before 1
period is complete). This intentionally causes spectral leakage. This will be
passed in with a parameter of whether to apply a windowing function or not. In
one case, a window function will be passed in, in the other no function will be
passed in.
					
\textbf{Output:}
The windowed output audio should have reduced spectral leakage. This is
represented by a sharper and more defined peak at the sine wave's frequency,
with reduced side-lobes in the frequency spectrum compared to the output of the
non-windowed case. 

\textbf{Test Case Derivation:} 
Spectral leakage occurs when a signal is truncated without windowing, causing
discontinuities at the edges of the truncated signal. Applying a windowing
function tapers the edges of the signal, reducing the discontinuities, and
confining the energy to the main frequency band, preventing leakage into other
frequencies from occurring. As such, in the windowed case, the frequency spectrum
should show a sharper peak at the sine wave's frequency, with reduced side-lobes
compared to the non-windowed case. The leakage will be measured by first
computing the peak amplitude $K_{\text{peak}}$, then applying the leakage
function. Where M represents the main lobe half-width in bins, based on the
windowing function used.  

\[
\text{Leakage} = 1 - \frac{\displaystyle\sum_{k = k_{\text{peak}} - M}^{k_{\text{peak}} + M} |X[k]|^2}{\displaystyle\sum_{k} |X[k]|^2}
\]

\textbf{How test will be performed:}
The test file will be uploaded as an artifact in the automated testing
framework. This test will trigger when a commit is made to any branch in the
repository. The audio filtering module will return 2 frequency-domain spectrums.
One spectrum will be generated without windowing, and the other will be applied
with a windowing function. For each spectrum, the amplitude of the main-lobe
will be compared with the largest side-lobe amplitude. The test passes if the
side-lobe in the filtered case is lower than the unfiltered case, which
indicates reduced spectral leakage. 

\item{\textbf{Test-FR-3.4} Hardware acceleration\\}

\textbf{Control:} Manual
					
\textbf{Initial State:} 
The audio filtering module is deployed on the microcontroller. A local computer
without hardware acceleration is available to the team to test the audio
filtering component on.
					
\textbf{Input:}
A 10 second digital audio signal sampled at 16 kHz containing waves with mixed
frequencies and amplitudes. The same input will be processed once with the
microcontroller, and once on a local development machine without hardware
acceleration. Each test will be timed to measure the processing speed. 
					
\textbf{Output:}
Both processing modes should produce equivalent spectrograms for the given audio
input. This means for each frequency in the spectrogram, the amplitude defined
in the hardware-accelerated mode should match the amplitude in the
non-accelerated mode within a defined tolerance of 0.1\%. The hardware
accelerated run should complete in less time than the non-accelerated run.

\textbf{Test Case Derivation:} 
Hardware acceleration uses specialized processing units to perform expensive
operations, like FFT or convolutions more efficiently than general-purpose.
Verifying the reduced runtime and equivalent outputs confirms the module
deployed on the hardware is functioning correctly. 

\textbf{How test will be performed:}
Manually running one configuration on the microcontroller, and another on the
local computer. Execution time will be measured with a profiler. A test function
will be written to measure the numerical equivalence of both outputs after
processing is completed. Profiler measurements will be manually inspected to
verify that the response time of the hardware accelerated mode is less than the
non-accelerated mode.

\item{\textbf{Test-FR-3.5} Flagging anomalies\\}

\textbf{Control:} Automatic
					
\textbf{Initial State:} 
The audio filtering module is initialized and ready to process audio input
retrieved from an audio file. 
					
\textbf{Input:}
Three separate audio clips represented in audio files. One will have a 1 second
sine wave with an amplitude that exceeds 1.0. Since amplitudes above 1.0 will
become clipped. Another clip will have a 1 second sine wave, that is replaced by
zeros halfway. This will test the lost signal case. The last clip will just have
2 seconds of zero amplitude, measuring the silence case. 
					
\textbf{Output:}
For each test case, the component should output the correct anomaly flag. In
this case, for the first audio clip, it should output a clipping flag. For the
second clip, it should output a lost signal flag. For the last clip, it should
output a silence flag.

\textbf{Test Case Derivation:} 
Clipping occurs when the amplitude of a signal exceeds the maximum representable
value (-1.0 to 1.0 for normalized audio). As such, for sine wave with an
amplitude above 1.0, clipping will occur. A lost signal is detected when a
section of the audio suddenly dropped to zero amplitude, which is the case in
the second clip. Silence is detected when the entire audio clip has zero
amplitude, which is the case in the last clip.

\textbf{How test will be performed:}
Each test file will be uploaded as an artifact in the automated testing
framework. There will be a test case for each test file, measuring each of the
anomalies mentioned above. THe test cases will trigger when a commit is made to
any branch in the repository. The audio filtering module will return 1 output
for each test case. Test will be verified by asserting whether the correct
anomaly is displayed for each audio file in each test case. 

\end{enumerate}


\subsubsection{Audio360 Engine Tests}

This section covers the tests for determining the accuracy of the Audio360
Engine in estimating the direction of incoming audio sources and their
classification. Error handling of the Audio360 Engine will also be evaluated.
Each test is associated with a functional requirement defined under section
\hyperref[SRS-sec:FR4]{3.2.4} of the SRS. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item{\textbf{Test-FR-4.1} Frequency and Error input capability testing.\\}

\textbf{Control:} Automatic

\textbf{Initial State:}
The Audio360 Engine module and its submodules have successfully initialized and
are ready to process audio from the audio filtering module or microphone array.
There are no errors flagged to the Audio360 Engine module.

\subsubsection*{Subtest 1: Frequency Input Capability}
\textbf{Input:}
A data stream of frequency-domain audio data sampled at 16 kHz by an array of 4
microphones. The audio data contains sine waves at low (100 Hz), mid (1 kHz),
and high (8 kHz) frequency ranges. No error flags are set in the input data.

\textbf{Output:}
The Audio360 Engine module accepts the input data with no errors. There should
be no error flags set in the output of the Audio360 Engine module. There should
also be a direction and classification output based on the input audio frequency
domain data.

\subsubsection*{Subtest 2: Error Input Capability}

\textbf{Control:} Automatic

\textbf{Input:}
A stream of random frequency-domain audio data sampled with a 16 kHz sample
rate. The input data will have error flags set, indicating either clipping, lost
signal, or silence.

\textbf{Output:}
The Audio360 Engine module accepts the input data with error flags. The output
does not contain a valid direction or classification. The output error flags
should reflect the input error flags.

\textbf{Test Case Derivation:}
The Audio360 Engine module must be able to handle both valid frequency-domain
audio data and audio data with error flags. Upon receiving error flags, the
module is expected to fail gracefully without crashing, and propagate the error
if necessary. The outputs in both subtests define the expected behavior of the
module under different input conditions.

\textbf{How test will be performed:}
Saved audio recordings from the microphone array will be used as artifacts in
the automated testing framework. Random audio data with error flags will be
generated at runtime. These tests will trigger when a pull request is made to
any branch. Inputs will be passed to the Audio360 Engine module, and outputs
will be checked against the expected outputs. 

\item{\textbf{Test-FR-4.2} Dependent component notification\\}

\textbf{Control:} Automatic

\textbf{Initial State:}
The Audio360 Engine module is deployed on the microcontroller and initialized
and has received new audio data from the audio filtering module without error
flags.

\textbf{Input:}
Mock audio data from the audio filtering module with no error flags.

\textbf{Output:}
All components in the system are expected to log important events for debugging
purposes. The Audio360 Engine module starts the processing pipeline by notifying
the dependent components to begin processing the new audio data. The sent
notification and received acknowledgment from dependent components should be
logged in the debugging logs for verification of pipeline integrity. 

\textbf{Test Case Derivation:}
The Audio360 Engine module must notify its dependent components to start
processing new audio data once it has received the data from the audio filtering
module. This forms the basis of a streaming audio processing pipeline.

\textbf{How test will be performed:}
The test will be performed automatically by simulating the input of new audio
data from the audio filtering module. The dependent components will be monitored
through debugging logs to verify that they receive the notification and start
processing the new audio data in the correct order. 

\item{\textbf{Test-FR-4.3} Pipeline flow management.\\}

\textbf{Control:} Automatic

\textbf{Initial State:}
The Audio360 Engine module has received new audio data from the audio filtering
module without error flags and has notified its dependent components to start
processing the new audio data.

\textbf{Input:}
Mock audio data from the audio filtering module with no error flags.

\textbf{Output:}
The Audio360 Engine module manages the flow of data through the processing
pipeline. It ensures that each component processes the data in the correct order
and that the output of one component is correctly passed as input to the next
component. The flow of data through the pipeline should be logged for
verification. Every dependent component in the pipeline is executed correctly
and in order.

\textbf{Test Case Derivation:}
The Audio360 Engine module must manage the flow of data through the processing
pipeline. Since individual dependent components are not expected to be aware of
other components in the pipeline, the Audio360 Engine module must ensure that
data is passed correctly between components, ensuring data integrity. The module
also needs to consider error states of each module to ensure that the pipeline
can handle errors gracefully.

\textbf{How test will be performed:}
The test will be performed automatically by simulating the input of new audio
data from the audio filtering module. The flow of data through the pipeline will
be monitored through debugging logs to verify that each component processes the
data in the correct order and that the output of one component is correctly
passed as input to the next component.

\item{\textbf{Test-FR-4.4} Error based pipeline suppression.\\}

\textbf{Control:} Automatic

\textbf{Initial State:}
The Audio360 Engine module has received new audio data from the audio filtering
module with error flags set.

\textbf{Input:}
Mock audio data from the audio filtering module with error flags set, indicating
either clipping, lost signal, or silence.

\textbf{Output:}
The Audio360 Engine module detects the error flags in the input data and
suppresses the processing pipeline. The module should log the error and
propagate the error flags to dependent components without attempting to process
the audio data. 

\textbf{Test Case Derivation:}
The Audio360 Engine module must be able to handle error flags in the input data.
Upon receiving error flags, the module is expected to fail gracefully without
crashing, and propagate the error if necessary. The processing pipeline should
be suppressed to prevent unnecessary processing of invalid data.

\textbf{How test will be performed:}
The test will be performed automatically by simulating the input of new audio
data from the audio filtering module with error flags set. The processing
pipeline will be monitored through debugging logs to verify that the pipeline is
suppressed and that error flags are handled appropriately. Once the error has
been resolved by clearing the error flags, the pipeline should resume normal
operation.

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Frequency Analysis Tests}

This section covers the tests for ensuring the Frequency Analysis component
which is responsible for analyzing frequency-domain audio data to estimate the
direction of incoming audio sources and their classification. Each test is
associated with a functional requirement defined under section
\hyperref[SRS-sec:FR5]{3.2.5} of the SRS.
\begin{enumerate}

\label{sec:freq-analysis-tests}
\item{\textbf{Test-FR-5.1} Audio Classification\\}

\textbf{Control:} Automatic

\textbf{Initial State:}
The Frequency Analysis module is initialized and ready to process frequency-
domain audio data retrieved from the Audio360 Engine module. 

\textbf{Input:}
A set of frequency-domain audio data samples representing different audio
classes. The classification of each sample is known beforehand for verification
purposes.

\textbf{Output:}
The Frequency Analysis module processes each input sample and outputs the
predicted audio class. The predicted class should match the known class for each
sample with a class level accuracy of at least 90\%.

\textbf{Test Case Derivation:}
The Frequency Analysis module is responsible for classifying audio sources based
on their frequency-domain characteristics. By providing known samples, the
module's classification accuracy can be evaluated.

\textbf{How test will be performed:}
The test will be performed automatically by feeding the frequency domain data of
the known audio samples to the Frequency Analysis module. The predicted classes
will be compared against the known classes to calculate the classification
accuracy. The test passes if the accuracy meets or exceeds the 90\% threshold
per class.

Accuracy is calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Accuracy}_{\text{class}} = \frac{\text{Number of Correct Predictions For 
Class}}{\text{Total Number of Samples for Class}} \times 100\%
\]

The overall accuracy across all classes is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Overall Accuracy} = \frac{\Sigma_{\text{class } \in \text{  tests}} 
\text{      Accuracy}_{\text{class}}}{Number of Classes}
\]

\item{\textbf{Test-FR-5.2} Direction Estimation\\}

\textbf{Control:} Automatic

\textbf{Initial State:}
The Frequency Analysis module is initialized and ready to process frequency-
domain audio data retrieved from the Audio360 Engine module for a four
microphone array.

\textbf{Input:}
A set of frequency-domain audio data samples representing audio sources
originating from known directions relative to the microphone array.

\textbf{Output:}
The Frequency Analysis module processes input samples from the four microphone
array and outputs the estimated direction of each audio source. The estimated
direction should be within +/- 45 degrees of the known direction for each
sample.

\textbf{Test Case Derivation:}
The Frequency Analysis module is responsible for estimating the direction of
audio sources based on the frequency-domain characteristics captured by the
microphone array. By providing samples from known directions, the module's
direction estimation accuracy can be evaluated.

\textbf{How test will be performed:}
The test will be performed automatically by feeding the frequency domain data of
the known direction samples to the Frequency Analysis module. The estimated
directions will be compared against the known directions to calculate the
estimation accuracy. All estimated directions must be within the +/- 45 degree
threshold of the known directions. In addition, the Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
will be calculated to quantify the average direction estimation error across all
samples. The MAE will need to be below 22.5 degrees for the test to pass using
the formula:

\[
\text{MAE} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} | \text{Estimated Direction}_i - 
\text{Known Direction}_i |
\]
where \(N\) is the total number of samples.

\item{\textbf{Test-FR-5.3} Radian Units.\\}

\textbf{Control:} Automatic

\textbf{Initial State:}
The Frequency Analysis module is initialized and ready to process frequency-
domain audio data retrieved from the Audio360 Engine module.

\textbf{Input:}
A set of random frequency-domain audio data samples.

\textbf{Output:}
The Frequency Analysis module processes input samples from the four microphone
array and outputs the estimated direction of each audio source in radians.

\textbf{Test Case Derivation:}
As per functional requirement FR5.3, the Frequency Analysis module must output
direction estimates in radians. This test verifies that the module adheres to
this requirement.

\textbf{How test will be performed:}
The test will be performed automatically by feeding the frequency domain data of
the known direction samples to the Frequency Analysis module. The output
directions will be checked to ensure they are expressed in radians. This will be
done by verifying that the output values fall within the range [0, \(2\pi\)]
radians.

\item{\textbf{Test-FR-5.4} Low confidence notification.\\}

\textbf{Control:} Automatic

\textbf{Initial State:}
The Frequency Analysis module is initialized and ready to process frequency-
domain audio data retrieved from the Audio360 Engine module.

\textbf{Input:}
A set of frequency-domain audio data samples that are randomly generated, making
it difficult to accurately classify the audio source. Known sample data will
also be included for control purposes to determine if the module can
differentiate between low and high confidence samples.

\textbf{Output:}
The Frequency Analysis module processes each input sample and outputs the
predicted classification along with a confidence score. For ambiguous samples,
the confidence score should be below a predefined threshold and the module
should flag the output as low confidence.

\textbf{Test Case Derivation:}
The Frequency Analysis module must be able to handle ambiguous or noisy audio
data and indicate when its predictions are uncertain. This test verifies that
the module correctly flags low-confidence outputs. The low confidence output
should be logged for verification and visible to the user through the
visualization controller.

\textbf{How test will be performed:}
The test will be performed automatically by feeding random frequency-domain
audio data samples \textbf{and} known samples to the Frequency Analysis module.
The predicted classifications and confidence scores will be evaluated to verify
that low-confidence outputs are correctly flagged. The test passes if all
ambiguous samples are flagged as low confidence and the known samples are
classified with high confidence. The confidence threshold will be calibrated
based on real world testing. 

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Visualization Controller Tests}

This section covers the tests for ensuring the correct output is being created
and sent from the visualization controller to the output display. Each test is
associated with a functional requirement defined under section
\hyperref[SRS-sec:FR6]{3.2.6} of the SRS. As such, each test will verify whether
the system meets the associated functional requirement. 

\begin{enumerate}

\item{\textbf{Test-FR-6.1} Notify direction of audio source \\}

\textbf{Control:} Manual
					
\textbf{Initial State:} 
The Visualization Controller module is deployed on the microcontroller and
initialized. Drivers for output display are installed in microcontroller, and
the microcontroller is connected to the output display. 
					
\textbf{Input:}
A mock audio source direction input, represented as the object taken by the
Visualization Controller module. The object will include an angle parameter in
degrees (0 to 360°), indicating the direction of the audio source relative to
the user. This can be an arbitrary angle, such as 0°, 90°, 180°, 270°. 
					
\textbf{Output:}
Corresponding visual indicator appears on the output display pointing in the
same direction as the input angle. The visualization appears within 1 second of
inputting the direction (\hyperref[SRS-sec:VC-3.2]{VC-3.2}) 

\textbf{Test Case Derivation:} 
When the audio system detects an incoming sound and reports its direction, the
visualization controller must translate that information into a user-facing cue
so that it may displayed on the output display. In this case, by sending an
object that outlines the direction of audio, that direction must be formatted by
the Visualization Controller so that it can be rendered on the output display.
This confirms that signals are being correctly translated.
					
\textbf{How test will be performed:}
Simulate a directional events by mocking the Visualization Controller's input
object with directions at 0°, 90°, 180°, 270°. Capture the output display output
by visually seeing if the correct direction is visualized. The test passes if
all simulated directions match the expected visual outputs and response time
thresholds (read using microcontroller logs) are met. 
					
\item{\textbf{Test-FR-6.2} Notify direction or classification failure\\}

\textbf{Control:} Manual
					
\textbf{Initial State:}
The Visualization Controller module is deployed on the microcontroller and
initialized. Drivers for output display are installed in microcontroller, and
the microcontroller is connected to the output display. 
					
\textbf{Input:}
2 mock audio source direction input, represented as the object taken by the
Visualization Controller module. The first object's metadata will include a
failure flag indicating that the direction of the audio source could not be
determined. The second object's metadata will include a failure flag indicating
that the classification of the audio source could not be determined.
					
\textbf{Output:}
For the first input object, a visual indicator appears on the output display
signifying that the direction of an audio source could not be determined. The
second input object should produce a different visual indicator on the output
display signifying that the classification of the audio source could not be
determined. 

\textbf{Test Case Derivation:} 
When the audio system fails to determine either the direction or classification,
 it will report that failure in the input object to the Visualization
 Controller. The Visualization Controller must then translate that failure
 information into a user-facing cue so that it may be displayed on the output
 display. This confirms that errors are correctly being processed and presented
 to the user. 
					
\textbf{How test will be performed:}
Simulate failure events by mocking the Visualization Controller's input object
with 2 failure flags, one for direction failure, and one for classification in
the object metadata. Capture the output display output by visually seeing if the
correct failure indicators are visualized on the output display. The test passes
if all simulated failure events match the expected visual outputs.

\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

This section covers system tests for the non-functional requirements (NFR)
listed under section \hyperref[SRS-sec:S.2]{S.2} of the SRS. Each subsection
will be focused on the NFR for a specific component will be verified through
testing.


\subsubsection{Embedded Firmware}

This section covers the tests for the non-functional requirements related to the
embedded firmware as defined in section \hyperref[SRS-sec:FR1]{3.2.1} of the
SRS.

\begin{enumerate}

\item{\textbf{Test-NFR1.1} Monotonic frame sequence processing\\}

\textbf{Type:} Non-Functional, Dynamic, Automatic
					
\textbf{Initial State:} 
The firmware is deployed on the microcontroller with audio capture active.
Multiple audio frames are being generated continuously from microphone input.
Frame timestamps and sequence numbers are logged.
					
\textbf{Input/Condition:} 
Continuous audio input for 60 seconds with audio frames arriving at the firmware
scheduler. Each frame has a timestamp indicating its capture time. Frames may
arrive with slight jitter but maintain chronological order based on capture
time.
					
\textbf{Output/Result:} 
Processing logs show that frames are processed in strict chronological order
based on their capture timestamps. No newer frame is processed before an older
frame. Earliest frames consistently receive highest priority in the task queue.
All 60 seconds of audio are processed without frame reordering.
					
\textbf{How test will be performed:} 
Deploy firmware to microcontroller with frame logging enabled. Capture 60
seconds of continuous audio. Export frame processing logs. Analyze log sequence
to verify timestamps are monotonically increasing (each processed frame has a
timestamp greater than or equal to the previous frame). The test passes if no
out-of-order processing is detected across the entire 60-second capture period.
					
\item{\textbf{Test-NFR1.2} Real-time processing speed\\}

\textbf{Type:} Non-Functional, Dynamic, Manual
					
\textbf{Initial State:} 
The firmware is deployed on the microcontroller with all audio processing
components active. Microphones are configured to sample at 16 kHz. Performance
monitoring is enabled to track processing frame rates.
					
\textbf{Input/Condition:} 
Continuous audio input captured at 16 kHz for 5 minutes. This generates
approximately 13,230,000 samples (44100 samples/second × 300 seconds) that must
be processed in real-time. Processing includes audio capture, synchronization,
and preparation for downstream components.
					
\textbf{Output/Result:} 
Performance logs show that the firmware processes all audio frames without
falling behind the input rate. Processing rate consistently exceeds 16 kHz
(e.g., processes 44100 samples in less than 1 second). No buffer overflows
occur. No frames are dropped due to processing delays.
					
\textbf{How test will be performed:} 
Deploy firmware to microcontroller and start continuous audio capture. Monitor
processing rate through performance counters and logs over 5-minute duration.
Calculate effective processing rate (samples processed per second). Check for
buffer overflow indicators in logs. The test passes if processing rate remains
above 16 kHz throughout the test and no overflows occur.

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Driver Layer}

This section covers the tests for the non-functional requirements related to the
driver layer as defined in section \hyperref[SRS-sec:FR2]{3.2.2} of the SRS.

\begin{enumerate}

\item{\textbf{Test-NFR2.1} Immediate error propagation\\}

\textbf{Type:} Non-Functional, Dynamic, Automatic
					
\textbf{Initial State:} 
The driver layer is running on the microcontroller. Hardware peripherals are in
various states (some operational, some generating errors). High-precision timing
measurement is configured to track error propagation delay.
					
\textbf{Input/Condition:} 
A sequence of N in the range of [50 , 1000] driver API calls that intentionally
trigger various error conditions: uninitialized hardware access, invalid
parameters, timeout conditions, and hardware disconnections. Each call is
timestamped at invocation and when error code is returned.
					
\textbf{Output/Result:} 
For all N error-triggering calls, the driver returns error codes within 10
milliseconds of the call. No error is delayed or queued for later reporting. The
median error propagation time is less than 1 millisecond. All errors are
reported to the firmware layer immediately without buffering.
					
\textbf{How test will be performed:} 
Execute automated test suite with N error-inducing driver calls. Measure time
from function entry to error code return using microcontroller cycle counters or
high-precision timers. Calculate propagation delay for each call. Generate
statistics (minimum, median, maximum, 99th percentile). The test passes if
maximum delay is less than 100 milliseconds and median delay is less than 10
milliseconds.

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Audio Filtering}


\begin{enumerate}

\item{\textbf{Test-NFR3.1} Accurate frequency-domain translation\\}

\textbf{Type:} Non-Functional, Dynamic, Automatic
					
\textbf{Initial State:} 
The audio filtering module is initialized and ready to process audio input
retrieved from an audio file. Reference implementation for true frequency-domain
representation is available for comparison. 
					
\textbf{Input/Condition:} 
A 1-second sine wave with arbitrary frequency sampled at 16 kHz. Additional
composite signals (white noise segments) may be used for robustness testing. 
					
\textbf{Output/Result:} 
The computed frequency-domain representation from the component should differ
from the true spectrum by less than 10\% error across all frequency bins. 
					
\textbf{How test will be performed:} 
Upload the audio file and high-precision FFT reference file to the automated
testing framework. Configure the test to run every time a commit is made to Git.
When a commit is made, the test suite will feed the audio file into the audio
filtering component. After retrieving the frequency-domain output, calculate the
mean relative error between component's output and the reference spectrum using
the following formula across all bins. If the mean is less than 10\%, the test
passes. 

\[
\text{Error} = \frac{\left|A_{\text{component}} - A_{\text{true}}\right|}{A_{\text{true}}} \times 100\%, 
\quad \forall A \in \text{Spectrum}
\]
					
\item{\textbf{Test-NFR3.2} Handle different input signal sizes\\}

\textbf{Type:} Non-Functional, Dynamic, Manual
					
\textbf{Initial State:} 
The audio filtering component is deployed on the microcontroller, and ready to
process audio input retrieved from an audio file. Logging has been implemented
on the microcontroller to capture time taken for processing.
					
\textbf{Input/Condition:} 
Digital audio signals of varying sizes: 512, 1024, 2048 and 4096 frames, all
sampled at 16 kHz. Each input contains an arbitrary test signal (sine wave with
arbitrary frequency). 
					
\textbf{Output/Result:} 
For each input size, the Audio Filtering component should process all frames
without exceeding time constraints defined in \hyperref[SRS-NFR1_2]{NFR1.2}. 
					
\textbf{How test will be performed:} 
Manually upload each audio file to the microcontroller and trigger processing.
Execution time will be measured using microcontroller logs. After processing is
complete, logs will be manually inspected to verify the processing time for each
input size meets the time constraints defined in the SRS.

\item{\textbf{Test-NFR3.3} Accuracy of FFT calculation exceeds 90\%\\}

\textbf{Type:} Non-Functional, Dynamic, Manual
					
\textbf{Initial State:} 
The audio filtering component is deployed on the microcontroller, and ready to
process continuous audio retrieved from the environment using attached
microphones. Mechanism to output spectrogram data from microcontroller is
available for future analysis.
					
\textbf{Input/Condition:} 
60 second continuous audio from the environment sampled at 16 kHz. The audio
should contain a mix of frequencies and amplitudes to simulate real-world
conditions. This same audio will be processed simultaneously by a high-precision
FFT reference implementation on a separate laptop.
					
\textbf{Output/Result:} 
The spectrogram output from the microcontroller should match the accuracy of the
reference implementation with at most 10\% relative error across all frequency
bins. The following formula can be used to calculate the relative error is shown
below. 

\[
\text{Error} = \frac{\left|A_{\text{component}} - 
A_{\text{true}}\right|}{A_{\text{true}}} \times 100\%, 
\quad \forall A \in \text{Spectrum}
\]

\textbf{How test will be performed:} 
Manually record 60 seconds of audio from the environment using microphones
attached to microcontroller. The same audio will be recorded on a separate
laptop for reference processing. After recording, both the microcontroller and
laptop will output their respective spectrograms. The spectrograms will be
compared by calculating the mean relative error across all frequency bins using
the formula above. If the mean error is less than 10\%, the test passes

module will log the processing time for each frame. The logs will be analyzed to
verify that the processing time for each frame does not exceed the time interval
between frames (1/16,000 seconds). If all frames are processed within this time
constraint, the test passes real-time processing constraints. This test will
have to be performed on the microcontroller to ensure accurate timing

The Visualization Controller module is deployed on the microcontroller and
initialized. Drivers for output display are installed in microcontroller, and
the microcontroller is connected to the output display. 
					
\textbf{Input/Condition:} 
3 mock audio sources, represented as the object taken by the Visualization
Controller module. These sources will be sent simultaneously to the module. The
object meta will have a parameter that outlines the priority of the audio
sources. The first object will have the highest priority, the second object will
have medium priority and the third object will have the lowest priority.

\textbf{Output/Result:} 
The output display should only visualize the highest priority audio source
first. So in this case, the direction of the first object should be visualized
on the output display, and the rest should be ignored. 
					
\textbf{How test will be performed:} 
Simulate multiple audio sources by mocking the Visualization Controller's input
objects with different priority levels. Capture the output display output by

\section{Appendix}

This is where you can place additional information.

\subsection{Symbolic Parameters}

The definition of the test cases will call for SYMBOLIC\_CONSTANTS. Their values
are defined in this section for easy maintenance.

\subsection{Usability Survey Questions}\label{sec:usability_survery_questions}

The following 10 essential survey questions will be used during user validation
sessions with members of the McMaster Sign Language Club who are hard of hearing
to assess the effectiveness and usability of \progname{Audio360}.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Background:} What is your level of hearing loss? (Complete
    deafness / Severe / Moderate / Mild)
    
    \textbf{Rationale:} This question directly relates to
    \hyperref[SRS-goal:user_friendly_interaction]{Goal G.1.5} (user-friendly
    interaction) by ensuring the system is tested across a range of hearing loss
    levels. Understanding the user's specific hearing profile helps validate
    that the system meets the needs of the primary stakeholder group
    (individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing) as defined in the SRS.
    
    \item \textbf{Visual Clarity:} How would you rate the clarity of the
    directional indicators? (1-5 scale: 1 = Very unclear, 5 = Very clear)
    
    \textbf{Rationale:} This question directly validates
    \hyperref[SRS-goal:visual_display]{Goal G.1.4} (visual display) and
    \hyperref[SRS-goal:audio_direction_analysis]{Goal G.2} (direction of arrival
    analysis). Clear directional indicators are essential for users to
    understand where sounds are coming from, which is a core requirement for
    maintaining situational awareness and safety.
    
    \item \textbf{Response Time:} Does the system respond quickly enough when
    sounds are detected? (Yes / No / Sometimes)
    
    \textbf{Rationale:} This question validates the real-time performance
    requirements from \hyperref[SRS-goal:audio_direction_analysis]{Goal G.1.2}
    and
    \hyperref[SRS-goal:audio_identification_analysis]{Goal G.3}. The system must
    provide near real-time feedback to be effective for safety-critical
    applications, as delayed responses could lead to missed safety cues.
    
    \item \textbf{Distraction Level:} Are the visual alerts distracting from
    your normal activities? (1-5 scale: 1 = Very distracting, 5 = Not
    distracting at all)
    
    \textbf{Rationale:} This question relates to
    \hyperref[SRS-goal:visual_display]{Goal G.4} (non-obstructive display) and
    \hyperref[SRS-goal:user_comfort]{Goal G.1.6} (user comfort). The system must
    enhance situational awareness without interfering with normal activities,
    ensuring it integrates seamlessly into daily life rather than creating
    additional barriers.
    
    \item \textbf{Sound Understanding:} Can you easily understand what type of
    sound the system is detecting? (Yes / No / Sometimes)
    
    \textbf{Rationale:} This question directly validates
    \hyperref[SRS-goal:audio_identification_analysis]{Goal G.1.3} (sound
    classification) and
    \hyperref[SRS-goal:user_friendly_interaction]{Goal G.1.5}
    (user-friendly interaction). Clear sound classification is essential for
    users to understand their environment and respond appropriately to different
    types of audio cues.
    
    \item \textbf{Confidence:} How confident do you feel about your situational
    awareness while using this system? (1-5 scale: 1 = Not confident, 5 = Very
    confident)
    
    \textbf{Rationale:} This question measures the overall effectiveness of the
    system in achieving its primary objective of improving situational awareness
    for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing. It validates that the
    combination of all system goals (G.1.1-G.1.6) successfully addresses the
    core problem of missed audio cues and safety risks.
    
    \item \textbf{Safety:} Would you feel safer using this system in real-world
    scenarios? (Yes / No / Unsure)
    
    \textbf{Rationale:} This question directly addresses the safety-critical
    nature of the application mentioned in the SRS context. It validates that
    the system successfully mitigates the safety risks associated with missed
    audio cues (car approaching, alarms, etc.) that were identified as the
    primary motivation for the project.
    
    \item \textbf{Comfort:} How comfortable is the smart glasses for extended
    wear? (1-5 scale: 1 = Very uncomfortable, 5 = Very comfortable)
    
    \textbf{Rationale:} This question directly validates
    \hyperref[SRS-goal:user_comfort]{Goal G.1.6} (user comfort for extended
    wear).
    Comfort is essential for daily use and adoption of the assistive technology,
    ensuring users can wear the system for extended periods without discomfort
    or fatigue.
    
    \item \textbf{Recommendation:} Would you recommend this system to other
    individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing? (Yes / No / Maybe)
    
    \textbf{Rationale:} This question provides an overall assessment of user
    satisfaction and perceived value, indicating whether the system successfully
    meets the needs of the primary stakeholder group. A positive recommendation
    suggests the system effectively addresses the identified gaps in existing
    assistive technologies.
    
    \item \textbf{Overall Feedback:} What was the most helpful aspect of using
    this system, and what improvements would you suggest?
    
    \textbf{Rationale:} This open-ended question allows users to provide
    qualitative feedback that can inform future iterations and improvements. It
    helps validate that the system's features align with user needs and
    identifies areas for enhancement to better achieve the project goals.
\end{enumerate}

These questions will be administered through semi-structured interviews and
observation sessions, providing both quantitative assessment and qualitative
feedback to evaluate the system's effectiveness for the target user community.

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What went well while writing this deliverable?

  \textbf{Sathurshan:} The team had a good understanding of the system as in the
  areas of the system that have the most critical risk to the project and
  functionality to the product. As a result, it helped the team know whats tests
  should be prioritized.

  \textbf{Nirmal:} Having a clear understanding of the project requirements from
  the SRS made it easier to derive test cases for various components.
  Furthermore, after working on the POC implementation, I think I had a good
  understanding of what artifacts can and will be used to test various
  components. For example, uploading pre-existing test files to automate testing
  in our pipeline.

  \textbf{Jay:} The team's previous work on the SRS really helped because we
  already had a clear picture of what each component needed to do. This made it
  straightforward to figure out what to test and how to test it.

  \textbf{Kalp:} What worked really well for this document was actually our
  previous well written SRS document. Since we had already gone through the
  process of writing the SRS document, we were able to hit the ground running
  with the VnV plan. We were able to use the same structure and format for the
  VnV plan as we did for the SRS document, which made it easier to write.
  Referencing the SRS document was also really easy to do since it was well
  written, organized, and discussed. 

  \textbf{Omar:} The team has done significant background research into the
  problem and the software architecture / methodologies that we will be dealing
  with. This made it straightforward to describe the various testing instruments
  that we will be using to verify and validate our system.

  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how did
    you resolve them?

  \textbf{Sathurshan:} The team has packed with midterms and assignments from
  other courses which made working on this deliverable and capstone difficult.
  There wasn't a good resolution other than getting the team to work on sections
  of the deliverable when possible.

  \textbf{Nirmal:} Trying to prioritize working on this deliverable with other
  commitments was very difficult. Especially since this deliverable was smaller
  compared to the SRS fr example, it made it difficult to push myself to work
  this in advance, since I thought other things from other courses were more
  pressing at the time, and that I can probably do this closer to the deadline.

  \textbf{Jay:} Balancing this deliverable with other course work was really
  challenging. I kept putting it off thinking I could do it later, but then
  other assignments kept piling up. I resolved this by setting specific time
  blocks to work on this deliverable.

  \textbf{Kalp:} The only pain point that I experienced wasn't even related to
  the document itself, but rather the fact that we had a lot of content to cover
  in the document, but with a lot of other course work as well at this time of
  year. Having to focus on the upcoming PoC implementation, as well as dealing
  with the midterm season made it quite difficult to focus on the VnV plan.

  \textbf{Omar:} Defining specific test without sounding very repetitive
  throughout the document was a challenge. To resolve this, I made sure to
  carefully read through each test case and ensure that they were unique and
  specific to the requirement they were testing.

  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete the verification and validation of your project?
  Examples of possible knowledge and skills include dynamic testing knowledge,
  static testing knowledge, specific tool usage, Valgrind etc.  You should look
  to identify at least one item for each team member.
  
  \textbf{Team respose:} The following are the knowledge and skills to perform
  verification and validation of the project:

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item gtest: the main testing tool for writing unit test for source code.
    \item Hardware debugging: There aren't many methods to debug on a
    microcontroller. Thus we need someone to investigate on how to debug our
    software on a microcontroller. If not possible, what other ways we can debug
    our software without the hardware.
    \item Integration testing: Testing the integration of the software on the
    hardware to verify it has been done correctly.
    \item Validating the product with the user. It is not intuitive at the
    moment on how we will know that the product addresses the user's problem
    effectively.
    \item Design verification requires an expert to ensure that the team's
    initial design is correct to minimize technical debt since there is not a
    lot of time left in this project.
  \end{enumerate}

  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item gtest: Omar will be pursuing this experience as he has experience with
    gtest from previous projects. He will be looking at how to write effective
    unit tests using gtest, as well as looking at best practices for writing
    unit tests for embedded systems. 
    \item Hardware debugging: Kalp will be pursuing this experience as his lack
    of experience with hardware debugging was felt as a technical blocker in his
    skill set. He will be looking at how to debug hardware on a microcontroller
    for the project, but also be reading into documentation and practicing good
    hardware debugging practices on his own personal projects. 
    \item Integration testing: Sathurshan will be pursuing this as he has
    experience of integration testing. He has already acquired partial skills
    from industry and will acquire more by looking at how public GitHub projects
    that uses hardware performed integration testing.
    \item Validating the product with the user: Jay will be pursuing this since
    he has experience with user research from his design background. He will
    work with the McMaster Sign Language Club to conduct structured interviews
    and usability testing sessions
    \item Design verification: Nirmal will be pursuing this since he has
    experience with design verification from previous internships and research
    background. He will be looking at best practices for design, using design
    principles and architecture styles as references to verify whether the
    correct one has been applied. 
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
