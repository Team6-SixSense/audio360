\section{Introduction}

Decomposing a system into modules is a commonly accepted approach to developing
software.  A module is a work assignment for a programmer or programming
team~\cite{ParnasEtAl1984}.  We advocate a decomposition
based on the principle of information hiding~\cite{Parnas1972a}.  This
principle supports design for change, because the ``secrets'' that each module
hides represent likely future changes.  Design for change is valuable in SC,
where modifications are frequent, especially during initial development as the
solution space is explored.  

Our design follows the rules layed out by \cite{ParnasEtAl1984}, as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item System details that are likely to change independently should be the
  secrets of separate modules.
\item Each data structure is implemented in only one module.
\item Any other program that requires information stored in a module's data
  structures must obtain it by calling access programs belonging to that module.
\end{itemize}

After completing the first stage of the design, the Software Requirements
Specification (SRS), the Module Guide (MG) is developed~\cite{ParnasEtAl1984}. The MG
specifies the modular structure of the system and is intended to allow both
designers and maintainers to easily identify the parts of the software.  The
potential readers of this document are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item New project members: This document can be a guide for a new project member
  to easily understand the overall structure and quickly find the
  relevant modules they are searching for.
\item Maintainers: The hierarchical structure of the module guide improves the
  maintainers' understanding when they need to make changes to the system. It is
  important for a maintainer to update the relevant sections of the document
  after changes have been made.
\item Designers: Once the module guide has been written, it can be used to
  check for consistency, feasibility, and flexibility. Designers can verify the
  system in various ways, such as consistency among modules, feasibility of the
  decomposition, and flexibility of the design.
\end{itemize}

The rest of the document is organized as follows. Section
\ref{SecChange} lists the anticipated and unlikely changes of the software
requirements. Section \ref{SecMH} summarizes the module decomposition that
was constructed according to the likely changes. Section \ref{SecConnection}
specifies the connections between the software requirements and the
modules. Section \ref{SecMD} gives a detailed description of the
modules. Section \ref{SecTM} includes two traceability matrices. One checks
the completeness of the design against the requirements provided in the SRS. The
other shows the relation between anticipated changes and the modules. Section
\ref{SecUse} describes the use relation between modules.

\section{Anticipated and Unlikely Changes} \label{SecChange}

This section lists possible changes to the system. According to the likeliness
of the change, the possible changes are classified into two
categories. Anticipated changes are listed in Section \ref{SecAchange}, and
unlikely changes are listed in Section \ref{SecUchange}.

\subsection{Anticipated Changes} \label{SecAchange}

Anticipated changes are the source of the information that is to be hidden
inside the modules. Ideally, changing one of the anticipated changes will only
require changing the one module that hides the associated decision. The approach
adapted here is called design for
change.

\begin{description}
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acHardware}:]
  The specific hardware on which the software is running. \\
  \textbf{Rationale:} There will be a benefit to using a hardware that is 
  smaller (better integration with glasses), cheaper (reduce costs for user),
  and stronger compute (allows for further advanced audio processing), if one
  exists in the market.

\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acNumMic}:] 
  The number of microphones in microphone array. \\
  \textbf{Rationale:} Depending on the performance on audio classification and
  directional analysis features, more or less microphones may be required than
  what is specified \hyperref[SRS-NFR9_2]{NFR9.2}.

\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acMicArrangement}:] 
  The arrangement of the microphones relative to each other. \\
  \textbf{Rationale:} The system may be deployed on devices other than
  glasses, such as a hat. As a result, the microphone arrangement can change.

\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acOutput}:]
  The output display hardware. At the moment, it is Rokid Glasses
  \cite{RokidGlasses}, which projects visuals onto glasses lens. Display may be
  changed to a simpler screen. \\
  \textbf{Rationale:} Due to Rokid Glasses availability and cost, it may be
  swapped with a cheaper and easily available display that can be integrated
  easily onto a glasses frame.

\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{NumClassification}:]
  The number of classification of audio sources. \\
  \textbf{Rationale:} \hyperref[SRS-NFR5_1]{NFR5.1} specifies at least 3 distinct
  audio classification of audio sources required. This can be changed to detect
  a single audio classification if detecting one source is more critical.

\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{SampleRate}:]
  The sample rate that audio is sampled from the environment from the
  environment. \\
  \textbf{Rationale:} \hyperref[SRS-NFR7_1]{NFR7.1} states to sample at 16 kHz
  as that is the minimum to analyze audible sounds to human. However, the scope
  can expand to detect sounds outside the human audible range to notify users of
  other critical sounds that human would have never been able to process on
  their own.

\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{SampleSize}:]
The sample size of audio data to analyze each time step. Currently specified
to be up to 4096 samples from \hyperref[SRS-NFR3_3]{NFR3.2}. \\
\textbf{Rationale:} For higher quality of audio processing, an higher sample
rate is required.

\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acVizContent}:] 
  The visualization content on the output display. \\
  \textbf{Rationale:} Stakeholders may require alternative information or a 
  different presentation format that is more effective and appropriate for
  the display. This is related to \hyperref[SRS-NFR6_2]{NFR6.2}

\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acHardwareAccel}:]
  Traditional algorithms may be used over
  \hyperref[SRS-def:hardware_acceleration]{hardware acceleration}. \\
  \textbf{Rationale:} Hardware acceleration can consume more power than
  traditional software algorithms. The trade-off of slower processing over
  power consumption may be desirable.

\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acConfidenceAction}:]
  Action when low confidence occurs during audio source classification. \\
  \textbf{Rationale:} According to \hyperref[SRS-FR5_4]{FR5.4}, the system
  shall notify user when results from classification is low confidence. However,
  this may be disregarded if the accuracy of the classification module is near 
  perfect. 

\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acSDCardLogging}:]
  The SD card logging method for diagnostic audio data.\\
  \textbf{Rationale:} The SD card diagnostic method is useful for 
  bulk data logging during testing. In a production system it is 
  going to be removed since no debug logs will be captured.
\end{description}

\subsection{Unlikely Changes} \label{SecUchange}

The module design should be as general as possible. However, a general system is
more complex. Sometimes this complexity is not necessary. Fixing some design
decisions at the system architecture stage can simplify the software design. If
these decision should later need to be changed, then many parts of the design
will potentially need to be modified. Hence, it is not intended that these
decisions will be changed.

\begin{description}
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucInput}:]
  The input devices for providing audio data from the environment are
  microphones. \\
 \textbf{Rationale:} Cheapest and easiest method of getting real-time audio
 from the environment of the user.

\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucClosed}:]
  The processor works as a closed system. That is no external devices other than
  the microphones and display can be connected, and all processing occurs on
  the processor (processing is not offloaded to another device). \\
 \textbf{Rationale:} Adheres to user \hyperref[SRS-goal:user_safety]{Goal 7},
 user safety and privacy, as well as \hyperref[SRS-FR9_1]{FR9.1}.

\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucMicSych}:]
  Microphones must always be synchronized at each sample.\\
 \textbf{Rationale:} Microphone synchronization is a requirement for directional
 analysis, which a core feature. Relates to \hyperref[SRS-FR1_2]{FR1.2:}

\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucHardwareAbstraction}:]
  The core features interact with hardware through an hardware abstraction
  layer.\\
 \textbf{Rationale:} This allows the achieve
 \hyperref[acHardware]{hardware antricipated change} without system redesign.

\end{description}

\section{Connection Between Requirements and Design} \label{SecConnection}

The design of the system is intended to satisfy the requirements developed in
the SRS. In this stage, the system is decomposed into modules. The connection
between requirements and modules is listed in Table~\ref{TblRT}.

\wss{The intention of this section is to document decisions that are made
  ``between'' the requirements and the design.  To satisfy some requirements,
  design decisions need to be made.  Rather than make these decisions implicit,
  they are explicitly recorded here.  For instance, if a program has security
  requirements, a specific design decision may be made to satisfy those
  requirements with a password.}

\begin{enumerate}

\item \hyperref[SRS-NFR2_1]{NFR2.1} and \hyperref[SRS-FR1_4]{FR1.4} specify 
that the system shall detect and propagate faults to the embedded firmware layer 
for appropriate handling. A software fault manager module, \mref{mFaultManager}, 
is responsible for monitoring and reacting to software error states. In addition, 
the \mref{mMicDiag} module monitors the microphone array for hardware faults.

  \item \hyperref[SRS-NFR3_3]{NFR3.2} specifies that the system shall support
  different audio sample sizes. Sample size directly affects both the speed and
  quality of audio analysis. Consequently, a dedicated module,
  \mref{mAudioSampling}, is responsible for managing this.

\item \hyperref[SRS-FR3_4]{FR3.4} recommends the use of
  \hyperref[SRS-def:hardware_acceleration]{hardware acceleration} to leverage
  hardware optimizations. However, there may be cases where traditional
  software algorithms perform more efficiently, such as when processing
  smaller datasets. Therefore, specific computational tasks are encapsulated
  within dedicated modules that determine whether to use hardware acceleration
  based on the input characteristics. This design consideration affects
  \mref{mAudioSpectralLeakage}, \mref{mAudioNormalizer}, and \mref{mFFT}.

\item \hyperref[SRS-FR3_5]{FR3.5} requires the system to detect anomalies in 
the audio stream. To address this, a dedicated module, \mref{mAudioAnomaly}, is
responsible for monitoring the audio data and identifying anomalies such as
clipping or dropouts.

\item \hyperref[SRS-FR4_5]{FR4.5} requires that the software be portable
  across different hardware platforms. This directly influenced the design
  decision to abstract the Audio360 Engine from the hardware layer. Inputs to
  the Audio360 Engine are maintained in a generic format, enabling deployment
  on various hardware targets, including simulation environments.

\item \hyperref[SRS-FR5_1]{FR5.1}, \hyperref[SRS-FR5_4]{FR5.4} requires the 
  frequency analysis component to classify audio sources. The classification 
  will be done by performing Principle Component Analysis (PCA) on extracted 
  features from the Mel-Frequency domain and performing Linear Discriminant 
  Analysis (LDA) on components to predict the classification. Since this is a 
  multi-step process, speciic computational tasks are encapsulated within 
  de-coupled modules that will be called individualy. This design affects 
  \mref{mMelFilter}, \mref{mDCT}, \mref{mPCA}, \mref{mLDA} and 
  \mref{mClassification}. 

\end{enumerate}

\section{Module Decomposition} \label{SecMD}

Modules are decomposed according to the principle of ``information hiding''
proposed by \cite{ParnasEtAl1984}. The \emph{Secrets} field in a module
decomposition is a brief statement of the design decision hidden by the
module. The \emph{Services} field specifies \emph{what} the module will do
without documenting \emph{how} to do it. For each module, a suggestion for the
implementing software is given under the \emph{Implemented By} title. If the
entry is \emph{OS}, this means that the module is provided by the operating
system or by standard programming language libraries.  \emph{\progname{}} means the
module will be implemented by the \progname{} software.

Only the leaf modules in the hierarchy have to be implemented. If a dash
(\emph{--}) is shown, this means that the module is not a leaf and will not have
to be implemented.

\section{Use Hierarchy Between Modules} \label{SecUse}

In this section, the uses hierarchy between modules is
provided. \cite{Parnas1978} said of two programs A and B that A {\em uses} B if
correct execution of B may be necessary for A to complete the task described in
its specification. That is, A {\em uses} B if there exist situations in which
the correct functioning of A depends upon the availability of a correct
implementation of B.  Figure \ref{FigUH} illustrates the use relation between
the modules. It can be seen that the graph is a directed acyclic graph
(DAG). Each level of the hierarchy offers a testable and usable subset of the
system, and modules in the higher level of the hierarchy are essentially simpler
because they use modules from the lower levels.

\wss{The uses relation is not a data flow diagram.  In the code there will often
be an import statement in module A when it directly uses module B.  Module B
provides the services that module A needs.  The code for module A needs to be
able to see these services (hence the import statement).  Since the uses
relation is transitive, there is a use relation without an import, but the
arrows in the diagram typically correspond to the presence of import statement.}

\wss{If module A uses module B, the arrow is directed from A to B.}
